# Pokemon Type Matchup Calculator

Calculate the type effectiveness of a move on a particular (dual type).

But that wasn't enough so I had to make it display the type chart in a table.

## Available commands:
t: enter Primary type
s: enter Secondary type
m: enter Move type
c: Compute effectiveness of move on primary, secondary type combo
o: list Offensive characteristics of primary type
d: list Defensive characteristics of primary type
l: List dual type characteristics (* = 4x effectiveness, _ = 0.25x effectiveness)
x: clear the secondary type
f: show the speciFied type(s)
q: Quit the program

My life is pain.
