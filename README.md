# Pokemon Type Matchup Calculator

Calculate the type effectiveness of a move on a particular (dual type).

But that wasn't enough so I had to make it display the type chart in a table.

## Available commands:
- **t:** Enter Primary type
- **s:** Enter Secondary type
- **m:** Enter Move type
- **c:** Compute effectiveness of move on primary, secondary type combo
- **o:** List Offensive characteristics of primary type
- **d:** List Defensive characteristics of primary type
- **l:** List dual type characteristics (* = 4x effectiveness, _ = 0.25x effectiveness)
- **x:** Clear the secondary type
- **f:** Show the speciFied type(s)
- **q:** Quit the program


My life is pain.
